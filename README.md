Day 12:- Naive Bayes Theorm

Naive Bayes is a simple algorithm used for classification tasks. 
It uses Bayes' Theorem to calculate probabilities and assumes all 
features are independent (even if they aren't). This makes it "naive" 
but surprisingly effective.

Why Use It?

Fast and Easy: Quick to train and easy to understand.
Great for Text Data: Works well for spam detection, sentiment analysis, and recommendation systems.
Handles Small Data Well: Doesn't need large datasets.
When to Use It?

When solving email spam detection (e.g., "Spam" vs. "Not Spam").
For sentiment analysis (e.g., classifying reviews as "Positive" or "Negative").
In news categorization (e.g., grouping articles by topics like "Sports" or "Technology").
For medical diagnosis (e.g., predicting if a patient has a disease based on symptoms).
